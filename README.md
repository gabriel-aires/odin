Distributed system for software deployment automation and developer aiding facilities (log visualization, custom runtime metrics, etc). It's based off another project of mine called "deploy-utils", originally written in pure shell script as a proof of concept.

## Administration Interface

Standalone cross-platform Tcl/Tk application
